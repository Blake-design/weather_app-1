  'humidity-info': 'Humidity is a measure of the amount of water vapor in the air. Relative humidity measures the amount of water in the air in relation to the maximum amount of water vapor (moisture). The higher the temperature, the more water vapor the air can hold. Relative humidity is what your morning weather reporter would refer to.',
  'pressure-info': `Atmospheric pressure refers to the weight of the air. High pressure means the air is heavy, and it sinks. Sinking air makes the environment very stable. Under high pressure you can generally expect sunny skies and calm weather. Low pressure is what causes active weather.`,
  'dewpoint-info': `The atmospheric temperature (varying according to pressure and humidity) below which water droplets begin to condense and dew can form.`,
  'visability-info': `Visibility is a measure of the horizontal opacity of the atmosphere at the point of observation and is expressed in terms of the horizontal distance at which a person should be able to see and identify`,
  'uv-info': `The UV Index represents the amount of skin-damaging UV radiation reaching the earth's surface at any instant of time. The basic UV Index forecast is given for solar noon â€” the sun's highest point in the sky and the time of the highest fluctuation in UV radiation (under clear sky conditions).`,
