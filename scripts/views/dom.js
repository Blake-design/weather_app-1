  'humidity-info': `The notion of air "holding" water vapor or being "saturated" by it is often mentioned in connection with the concept of relative humidity. This, however, is misleading—the amount of water vapor that enters (or can enter) a given space at a given temperature is almost independent of the amount of air (nitrogen, oxygen, etc.) that is present. Indeed, a vacuum has approximately the same equilibrium capacity to hold water vapor as the same volume filled with air; both are given by the equilibrium vapor pressure of water at the given temperature.[4][5] There is a very small difference described under "Enhancement factor" below, which can be neglected in many calculations unless high accuracy is required.`,
  'pressure-info': `Atmospheric pressure refers to the weight of the air. High pressure means the air is heavy, and it sinks. Sinking air makes the environment very stable. Under high pressure you can generally expect sunny skies and calm weather. Low pressure is what causes active weather.`,
  'dewpoint-info': `the atmospheric temperature (varying according to pressure and humidity) below which water droplets begin to condense and dew can form.`,
  'visability-info': `Visibility is a measure of the horizontal opacity of the atmosphere at the point of observation and is expressed in terms of the horizontal distance at which a person should be able to see and identify`,
  'uv-info': `The UV Index represents the amount of skin-damaging UV radiation reaching the earth's surface at any instant of time. The basic UV Index forecast is given for solar noon — the sun's highest point in the sky and the time of the highest fluctuation in UV radiation (under clear sky conditions).`,
